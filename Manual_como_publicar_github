Install ghp-import

pip install ghp-import
Update the settings for your GitHub pages site:

a. Use the gh-pages branch to host your website.

b. Choose root directory / if you’re building the book in it’s own repository. Choose /docs directory if you’re building documentation with jupyter-book.

From the main branch of your book’s root directory (which should contain the _build/html folder) call ghp-import and point it to your HTML files, like so:

ghp-import -n -p -f _build/html
